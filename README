# forward-array

Forward Array is a small, automated data pipeline built with Python to fetch, store, and analyze market prices locally.  
It’s my personal lab for learning automation, data ops, and Python by doing.

## 🌱 About Me

Hello, I’m **Joshua Berry** – an aspiring developer focused on:

- Automation & data operations  
- Building small, real systems instead of toy examples  
- Learning in public and documenting the journey

## 🚀 What Forward Array Does

Forward Array currently:

- Polls price data on a schedule and saves it locally
- Updates positions / gains using the latest prices
- Computes portfolio-level metrics (PnL and related stats)
- Keeps a local log so everything still works offline

This project will grow over time as I learn more about Python, automation, and system design.

## 🌱 About Me
             
Hello, I’m **Joshua Berry** – an aspiring developer focused on:

- Automation & data operations 
- Building small, real systems instead of toy examples  
- Learning in public and documenting the journey  

I work full-time outdoors in the Florida heat and spend my evenings building tools like Forward Array.  
I’m comfortable with long, consistent weeks and doing the boring parts well.

## 🚀 What Forward Array Does

Forward Array currently:

- Polls price data on a schedule and saves it locally
- Updates positions / gains using the latest prices
- Computes portfolio-level metrics (PnL and related stats)
- Keeps a local log so everything still works offline

This project will grow over time as I learn more about Python, automation, and system design.
